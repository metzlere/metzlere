# Hi there, I'm Eric

I'm a data scientist in Pittsburgh, PA.

## About Me

- Most of my work is focused on developing and deploying classical ML
- I'm a father of 2 young ones (and 1 more on the way)
- I served in the Army on Active Duty and am currently a Reservist
- In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting, and Jiu Jitsu

## Projects

### **ml-ops-reference-architecture** 
This is a reference architecture that I've built for classical ML in production. It was designed for an organization with a low level of data maturity and is not fully automated, requiring manual triggers of the model development component and manual selection of a champion model. It uses all open-source tools. 

### **context-builder**
Context Builder is a comprehensive toolkit for preparing codebase context for LLM interactions. It's designed for developers who need to manually extract and format code context when integrated agentic coding tools (like Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) aren't available or suitable for their environment. This is an updated version of `codebase-dumper`, built with Claude Code.

### **codebase-dumper**  
LLMs have been very helpful for me in programming, but copying and pasting code snippets repeatedly can get old. This tool dumps all source code from a target directory into a Markdown file, making it easy to copy into an LLM prompt. I've found that more powerful models (like `o3-mini-high`) can give better answers with less back and forth when given full context of the codebase. This approach can speed up development big time for small and low-complexity personal projects. For professional projects, I don't have the same access to powerful LLMs, and I tend to use them to mainly to assist with code syntax as well as brainstorming approaches to solving proxy problems.  

### **531-tracker**  
**A web app for tracking progress on Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 lifting program**, logging workouts, and tracking volume over time. I am certainly not a web developer - this was a learning project for me and it was cool to see how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the backend connect. Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite  
**Features:**  
- Track weekly workout progress  
- Store lifting logs in an SQLite database  
- Hosted on a Raspberry Pi an accessible from the internet (DM me if you’d like to try it out!)

## Skills
