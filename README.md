# Hi there, I'm Eric

I'm a data scientist in Pittsburgh, PA.

## About Me

- 💻 I’m currently building an MLOps framework and reference architecture for my org, while developing and deploying classical ML.
- 🌱 For fun, I'm dabbling in web development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and hosting web apps on my Raspberry Pi
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I'm a father of 2 young ones (and 1 more on the way)
- 🪖 I served in the Army on Active Duty and am currently a Reservist
- 📖 🏋🏻‍♂️ 🤼‍♂️ In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting, and Jiu Jitsu

## Projects

### 🔹 **codebase-dumper**  
LLMs have been very helpful for me in programming, but copying and pasting code snippets repeatedly can get old. This tool **dumps all source code from a target directory into a Markdown file**, making it easy to copy into an LLM prompt. I've found that more powerful models (like `o3-mini-high`) can give better answers with less back and forth when given full context of the codebase.  

### 🔹 **531-tracker**  
**A web app for tracking progress on Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 lifting program**, logging workouts, and tracking volume over time. I am certainly not a web developer - this was a learning project for me and it was cool to see how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the backend connect. 
**🔹 Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite  
**🔹 Features:**  
- Track weekly workout progress  
- Store lifting logs in an SQLite database  
- Hosted on a Raspberry Pi an accessible from the internet (DM me if you’d like to try it out!)

### 🔹 **Planned Projects**
- **Malicious Domain Classification** using LSTM 
- **Object Detection in Satellite Imagery**  
- **Therapy Chatbot** that only responds in Creed lyrics (joking… or maybe not)  


## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Bash
- **Tools & Technologies:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Flask, FastAPI, MLFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain, Power BI
